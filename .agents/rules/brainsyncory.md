## Safety — Never Run Destructive Commands

> Dangerous commands are actively monitored.
> Critical/high risk commands trigger error notifications in real-time.

- **NEVER** run `rm -rf`, `del /s`, `rmdir`, `format`, or any command that deletes files/directories without EXPLICIT user approval.
- **NEVER** run `DROP TABLE`, `DELETE FROM`, `TRUNCATE`, or any destructive database operation.
- **NEVER** run `git push --force`, `git reset --hard`, or any command that rewrites history.
- **NEVER** run `npm publish`, `docker rm`, `terraform destroy`, or any irreversible deployment/infrastructure command.
- **NEVER** pipe remote scripts to shell (`curl | bash`, `wget | sh`).
- **ALWAYS** ask the user before running commands that modify system state, install packages, or make network requests.
- When in doubt, **show the command first** and wait for approval.

**Stack:** TypeScript · React + Tailwind

### 📚 Core Framework Rules: [callstackincubator/react-native-best-practices]
# React Native Best Practices

## Overview

Performance optimization guide for React Native applications, covering JavaScript/React, Native (iOS/Android), and bundling optimizations. Based on Callstack's "Ultimate Guide to React Native Optimization".

## Skill Format

Each reference file follows a hybrid format for fast lookup and deep understanding:

- **Quick Pattern**: Incorrect/Correct code snippets for immediate pattern matching
- **Quick Command**: Shell commands for process/measurement skills
- **Quick Config**: Configuration snippets for setup-focused skills
- **Quick Reference**: Summary tables for conceptual skills
- **Deep Dive**: Full context with When to Use, Prerequisites, Step-by-Step, Common Pitfalls

**Impact ratings**: CRITICAL (fix immediately), HIGH (significant improvement), MEDIUM (worthwhile optimization)

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:
- Debugging slow/janky UI or animations
- Investigating memory leaks (JS or native)
- Optimizing app startup time (TTI)
- Reducing bundle or app size
- Writing native modules (Turbo Modules)
- Profiling React Native performance
- Reviewing React Native code for performance

## Security Notes

- Treat shell commands in these references as local developer operations. Review them before running, prefer version-pinned tooling, and avoid piping remote scripts directly to a shell.
- Treat third-party libraries and plugins as dependencies that still require normal supply-chain controls: pin versions, verify provenance, and update through your standard review process.
- Treat Re.Pack code splitting as first-party artifact delivery only. Remote chunks must come from trusted HTTPS origins you control and be pinned to the current app release.

## Priority-Ordered Guidelines

| Priority | Category | Impact | Prefix |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | FPS & Re-renders | CRITICAL | `js-*` |
| 2 | Bundle Size | CRITICAL | `bundle-*` |
| 3 | TTI Optimization | HIGH | `native-*`, `bundle-*` |
| 4 | Native Performance | HIGH | `native-*` |
| 5 | Memory Management | MEDIUM-HIGH | `js-*`, `native-*` |
| 6 | Animations | MEDIUM | `js-*` |

## Quick Reference

### Optimization Workflow

Follow this cycle for any performance issue: **Measure → Optimize → Re-measure → Validate**

1. **Measure**: Capture baseline metrics (FPS, TTI, bundle size) before changes
2. **Optimize**: Apply the targeted fix from the relevant reference
3. **Re-measure**: Run the same measurement to get updated metrics

### 📚 Core Framework Rules: [callstackincubator/upgrading-react-native]
# Upgrading React Native

## Overview

Covers the full React Native upgrade workflow: template diffs via Upgrade Helper, dependency updates, Expo SDK steps, and common pitfalls.

## Typical Upgrade Sequence

1. **Route**: Choose the right upgrade path via [upgrading-react-native.md][upgrading-react-native]
2. **Diff**: Fetch the canonical template diff using Upgrade Helper via [upgrade-helper-core.md][upgrade-helper-core]
3. **Dependencies**: Assess and update third-party packages via [upgrading-dependencies.md][upgrading-dependencies]
4. **React**: Align React version if upgraded via [react.md][react]
5. **Expo** (if applicable): Apply Expo SDK layer via [expo-sdk-upgrade.md][expo-sdk-upgrade]
6. **Verify**: Run post-upgrade checks via [upgrade-verification.md][upgrade-verification]



## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:
- Moving a React Native app to a newer version
- Reconciling native config changes from Upgrade Helper
- Validating release notes for breaking changes

## Quick Reference

|------|-------------|
| [upgrading-react-native.md][upgrading-react-native] | Router: choose the right upgrade path |

### 📚 Core Framework Rules: [tinybirdco/tinybird-typescript-sdk-guidelines]
# Tinybird TypeScript SDK Guidelines

Guidance for using the `@tinybirdco/sdk` package to define Tinybird resources in TypeScript with complete type inference.

## When to Apply

- Installing or configuring @tinybirdco/sdk
- Defining datasources or pipes in TypeScript
- Creating typed Tinybird clients
- Using type-safe ingestion or queries
- Running tinybird dev/build/deploy commands for TypeScript projects
- Migrating from legacy .datasource/.pipe files to TypeScript
- Defining connections (Kafka, S3, GCS)
- Creating materialized views, copy pipes, or sink pipes

## Rule Files

- `rules/getting-started.md`
- `rules/configuration.md`
- `rules/defining-datasources.md`
- `rules/defining-endpoints.md`
- `rules/typed-client.md`
- `rules/low-level-api.md`
- `rules/cli-commands.md`
- `rules/connections.md`
- `rules/materialized-views.md`
- `rules/copy-sink-pipes.md`
- `rules/tokens.md`

## Quick Reference

- Install: `npm install @tinybirdco/sdk`
- Initialize: `npx tinybird init`
- Dev mode: `tinybird dev` (uses configured `devMode`, typically branch)
- Build: `tinybird build` (builds against configured dev target)
- Deploy: `tinybird deploy` (deploys to main/production)
- Preview in CI: `tinybird preview`
- Server-side only; never expose tokens in browsers

- [JavaScript/TypeScript] Use === not == (strict equality prevents type coercion bugs)

## Available Tools (ON-DEMAND only)
- `sys_core_01(q)` — Deep search when stuck
- `sys_core_05(query)` — Full-text lookup
> Context above IS your context. Do NOT call sys_core_14() at startup.
